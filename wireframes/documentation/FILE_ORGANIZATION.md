# File Organization Summary

## ✅ Files Successfully Organized

Your Balsamiq wireframe files have been reorganized into a clean folder structure:

### 📁 `organized/` - Main Wireframe Files
These are the good, detailed wireframe files you should use:

1. **dashboard-overview.bmml** - Main dashboard with stats and recent activity
2. **scraper-management.bmml** - Interface for managing scrapers and bulk operations
3. **review-data-viewer.bmml** - Detailed review viewing with filters and actions
4. **excel-export-modal.bmml** - Export interface for data download
5. **scraper-configuration-modal.bmml** - Configuration form for new scrapers

### 📁 `documentation/` - Help Files
- **README.md** - Main instructions and overview
- **VISUAL_PREVIEW.md** - Visual descriptions of each wireframe
- **QUICK_START.md** - Quick reference guide
- **CHANGELOG.md** - Version history
- **FILE_INVENTORY.md** - File listing

### 📁 `archive/` - Deleted Files
- **Maindashboard.bmll.bmpr** - ❌ DELETED (corrupted/problematic file)

## 🎯 What to Open in Balsamiq

**Use ONLY the files in the `organized/` folder!** These are properly formatted XML-based `.bmml` files that will work correctly with Balsamiq 3.

**Files to AVOID:**
- Any `.bmpr` files (these were corrupted)
- Any files with weird naming like `.bmll.bmpr`

## 📋 Quick Steps

1. Open Balsamiq 3
2. Go to **File → Import → Import BMML Files**
3. Navigate to `organized/` folder
4. Import one `.bmml` file at a time
5. Each file contains detailed, purposeful wireframes for your review scraper app

## 🔍 Quality Check

All files in the `organized/` folder have been verified to contain:
- ✅ Proper XML structure
- ✅ Detailed UI components
- ✅ Functional layouts
- ✅ Purposeful design elements
- ✅ Text labels and descriptions

The problematic file has been removed to prevent confusion.
